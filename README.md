# Python Flask - Demo Web Application

This is a simple Python Flask web application. The app provides system information and a realtime monitoring screen with dials showing CPU, memory, IO and process information.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

## Building & Running Locally

### Pre-reqs

- Be using Linux, WSL or MacOS, with bash, make etc
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - for running locally, linting, running tests etc
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - for running as a container, or image build and push
- [AWS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux) - for deployment to AWs EC2

Clone the project to any directory where you do development work

```
git clone https://github.com/duyilemi/gitlab-cicd-python-docker-ec2
```

### Makefile

A standard GNU Make file is provided to help with running and building locally.

```text

clean                üßπ Clean up project
```

The app runs under Flask and listens on port 3000 by default, this can be changed with the `PORT` environmental variable.

# Containers

Run in a container with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 charlied0cker/python-cicd-demo:latest
```

Should you want to build your own container, use `make image` and the above variables to customise the name & tag.

## Kubernetes

The app can easily be deployed to Kubernetes using Helm

# GitHub Actions CI/CD

A working set of CI and CD release GitHub Actions workflows are provided `.github/workflows/`, automated builds are run in GitHub hosted runners
